![Application Preview](docs/home-desktop.png)

## Overview

Welcome to the React Hostfully Booking Application! This web application allows users to manage property bookings efficiently. It was developed as part of a technical test for a senior React developer position. The application is built using React 18, Node 20, TypeScript, and Sass.

## Features

### 1. Create a Booking

Users can easily create a new booking by selecting a start and end date for their reservation on a property.

### 2. Read a Booking

View and retrieve information about existing bookings, including details such as start and end dates.

### 3. Update a Booking

Modify the details of an existing booking, such as adjusting the start or end date.

### 4. Delete a Booking

Remove a booking from the system when it's no longer needed.

## Technologies Used

- React 18
- Node 20
- TypeScript
- Sass
- Vite
- Jest

## Global State Management

The application utilizes a global state store to manage the state of bookings. The specific global state management library used is of your choice.

## Validation & User Experience

To enhance user experience, the application incorporates logic to prevent double bookings (overlapping reservations). Additionally, the start and end dates for each booking are validated to ensure accuracy.

## Responsive Design

The webpages are designed to be fully responsive, providing a seamless experience for users on both desktop and mobile devices.

3. **Additional Features**: Consider adding features such as search functionality, sorting, and filtering to enhance the overall usability of the application.

4. **Improved Styling**: Enhance the visual appeal of the application by refining the styling and incorporating modern design principles.

5. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing using hest to ensure the robustness and reliability of the application.
